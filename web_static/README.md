AirBnB Clone - Web Static
This project is the first step in building an Airbnb clone web application, focusing on the front-end development. The goal is to create simple HTML static pages and apply styles using CSS. No JavaScript or data loading is involved at this stage.

Task 0: Inline Styling
Create an HTML page that displays a header and a footer with the following styling:

Body has no margin and no padding.
Header has a red background color (#FF0000), a height of 70px, and spans the full width.
Footer has a green background color (#00FF00), a height of 60px, and is always at the bottom of the page, centered both vertically and horizontally. It also displays the text "Best School."
Task 1: Head Styling
Write an HTML page with the same structure as Task 0 but apply the styling using the style tag in the head section of the document.

Task 2: CSS Files
Build an HTML page similar to Task 1 but this time, use external CSS files for styling. Create three CSS files:

styles/2-common.css: For global styles.
styles/2-header.css: For header styling.
styles/2-footer.css: For footer styling.
Task 3: Zoning Done!
Create an HTML page with a header and footer using external CSS files. The styling should be as follows:

Common: No margin, no padding, font color #484848, and specific font properties.
Header: White color, height of 70px, and a border at the bottom.
Footer: White color, height of 60px, a border at the top, and text "Best School" centered vertically and horizontally.
Task 4: Search!
Design an HTML page with a header, footer, and a filters box with a search button. The filter section is styled with CSS, and the page structure should include a button for searching.

Task 5: More Filters
Create an HTML page with a header, footer, filters box, and additional filters for locations and amenities. Style the filters with CSS to meet the provided requirements.

Task 6: It's (H)over
Enhance the filters from Task 5 to display a contextual dropdown when the mouse hovers over them. The dropdown should contain location and amenity options.

Task 7: Display Results
Design an HTML page that displays a header, footer, filters box, and a section to show search results, including multiple "Places" listings.

Task 8: More Details
Create an HTML page with a header, footer, filter box, and search results. Each Place listing in the results should display more information, including price, details, user information, and a description.

General Requirements
All HTML and CSS files should be W3C compliant and validated.
CSS files should be organized in the styles folder.
Images should be stored in the images folder.
Avoid using !important and id selectors in the CSS.
Do not use <img>, <embed>, or <iframe> tags.
No JavaScript is allowed.
